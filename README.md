# Java Swing Library System Application

A desktop application for library management built using Java and Swing. This project showcases my experience with Java development and desktop application creation, focusing on the management of library resources such as books and members.

## About the Project  
This project implements a simple library management system where users can manage books, issue and return them, and track member information. The application is developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and incorporates additional libraries for file management and utility functions. It was created as part of my university coursework to demonstrate practical skills in Java, and serves as a learning exercise to explore the capabilities of desktop application development.

Please note that while the application provides basic functionality, it might still have some bugs or incomplete features as it is a work in progress.

## Features
- **Manage Books**: Add, edit, and remove books from the library catalog.
- **Issue and Return Books**: Track the issue and return of books by library members.
- **Member Management**: Add, update, and remove library members.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for books or members based on different criteria.
- **File Management**: Data is saved and loaded using Java file I/O.
